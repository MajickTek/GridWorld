# GridWorld
An updated version of [GridWorld](https://horstmann.com/gridworld/)

The original code was rather old and had a lot of supressed warning annotations, so I refactored a lot of it.

I also included 2 projects:


`loopWorld` is demo code retrieved from the web archive which showcases a new type of world called StepWorld that can be paused by actors.

`testProject` is old code of mine which shows how to make the "camera" follow an actor
