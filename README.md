# GridWorld
An updated version of [GridWorld](https://horstmann.com/gridworld/)

The original code was rather old and had a lot of supressed warning annotations, so I refactored a lot of it.

I also included the StepWorld project after I hunted for the code on the web archive, as the link to the code is now dead.
